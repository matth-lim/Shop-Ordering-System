# Shop ordering system

This is one of my first C project, it is a simple system which uses the command line as its interface for the program. This project aims to help me learn more about low level programming like memory management, pointers, file I/O operations, etc. Text files were used to act as the database for the program. 

Concepts learned:
- File Handling: Reading and writing text files
- Data validation: Ensuring the user's input data is valid
- Pointers: File pointers are used for file operations like reading, writing, appending and modifying text files
- String Manipulation: String operations such as concatenating characters, removing substrings, and checking for duplicates are used in the program
- Input and output handling: Prompting the user for input, handling errors, and displaying outputs.

Below shows a demo of the project.
